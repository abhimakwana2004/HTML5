    <h1>In HTML5, both canvas and svg are used to create graphics, but they are used in different ways and have different characteristics. Here's an overview of each</h1>

   <h1> 1. canvas Element</h1>
        <h3>The canvas element is a bitmap-based drawing surface where you can use JavaScript to draw shapes, images, and other visual content. It is good for rendering graphics on the fly, like in games or visualizations, but does not inherently retain the state of objects (i.e., once something is drawn, it's just pixels)</h3>
        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
        <h3>Bitmap-based: Graphics are rendered pixel-by-pixel, and after drawing, the shapes cannot be easily manipulated</h3>
        <h3>Requires JavaScript: Drawing on a canvas relies on JavaScript for rendering 2D or 3D graphics using APIs like the Canvas API or WebGL.</h3>
        <h3>Dynamic: Ideal for real-time graphics like animations, game rendering, or data visualizations (e.g., charts).
        </h3>

   <h1>2. svg (Scalable Vector Graphics) Element</h1>
         <h3>The svg element is used for creating vector-based graphics. It uses XML to describe the structure and appearance of graphical elements like lines, circles, text, and shapes. SVG graphics are resolution-independent and scalable without losing quality, making them ideal for graphics that need to be responsive or zoomable</h3>
        <h2>Key Features:</h2> 
        <h3>Vector-based: Uses mathematical formulas to draw shapes, meaning graphics can scale without losing quality</h3>
        <h3>Retains Object State: Each shape is an object that can be styled, transformed, or manipulated with CSS, JavaScript, or directly in the markup</h3>
        <h3>No JavaScript Required: Can be used declaratively with markup alone, but JavaScript can also be used to interact with the elements for animations or dynamic updates.</h3>
